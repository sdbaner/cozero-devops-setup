## Objective

Deploy a secure, scalable web application on AWS, incorporating best practices in deployment, security, monitoring, and infrastructure management using the Free Tier of an AWS account.

## Overview

1. **Infrastructure Setup:**
    - Provision the necessary AWS resources using an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
    - Resources should include:
        - An ECS cluster to host the application.
        - An RDS instance for the application's database.
2. **Application Deployment:**
    - Deploy a simple web application (a basic "Hello World" app is sufficient) to the ECS cluster.
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate the deployment process.
3. **Security Implementation:**
    - Implement security best practices, including:
        - Configuring security groups and network ACLs to restrict access.
        - Applying IAM policies.
        - Ensuring data in transit and at rest is encrypted.
4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Set up monitoring and logging for the application and infrastructure using tools such as AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana.
    - Configure alerts for critical metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, application errors).
5. **Cost Optimization:**
    - Implement strategies to optimize costs, such as selecting appropriate instance types and leveraging AWS cost management tools.
